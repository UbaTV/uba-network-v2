* Kingdoms Survival:

* Kingdoms Survival is generic survival, but with a twist to keep players engaged and build sub-communities within the server and even cause (fun) rivalries between those sub-communities.

* Below is the general mechanics which makes kingdoms different from vanilla survival.

* Players generally chose between three (or more) categories of characters like Knights, Elves, Ogres etc etc. Each of these characters have their own distinct abilities, or their own starter kits. This is decided by the server owner.

* Players will also be able to create their own ‘kingdom’ which in other words is their faction name. This is commonly done through /k create [name] and /k disband.

* Once a good place has been found, a player can claim land which they desire through a simple command, for example a commonly used command is /k claim or /k unclaim.
* To claim land, there must also be money to do so. To make things a bit easier for players, I would suggest making the first claim free, but once they claim, if they later change their mind and unclaim land, they will not get another claim for free and will have to pay.

* I would suggest claims to increase in increments of 500, starting from 500 also. Claims generally are a chunk size, meaning 16x16 in total. Also, if a player unclaims their land I would suggest the money they receive in return is 50% less than what they paid. This is an incentive to choose land wisely.

* I’m the spawning area, I would make this a gathering area for people to find new members for their kingdoms and other means of communication and access to players.

* Players have the option to enemy, ally and truce with opposing kingdoms. Alongside this, each of these statuses has their own permissions which go alongside. For example, enemies will not be able to access anything in a base Including doors, chests, buttons etc. Ally’s will have certain commands and so will truce’s. This is all down to discretion of the server owner.

* On the topic of permissions, there will also be different ranks within a kingdom example being Leader, Co. Leader, member+, member etc. Each of these will have their own permissions of what they can access and whether they can build/break blocks, claim land etc.

* If A was to enemy B, this would mean A can attack B if they were to set foot upon their kingdom whilst B cannot. The only way which B would be able to inflict pain on A would be through a neutral zone which is unclaimed land. I would also suggest making it so enemy kingdoms cannot claim land right next to their enemy’s as this could cause real arguments as there are some players who would do this as a means of griefing.
